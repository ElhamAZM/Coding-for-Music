# Musical Instrument Classification 

Hornbostel-Sachs instrument classification system was created by Erich Moritz von Hornbostel and
Curt Sachs. Among ethnomusicologists, it is the most widely used system for classifying musical
instruments.
Instruments are classified using 5 different categories depending on the manner in which the instrument
creates the sound: Idiophones, Membranophones, Chordophones, Aerophones, & Electrophones.
