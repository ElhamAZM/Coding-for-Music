# Musical Instrument Classification 

Hornbostel-Sachs instrument classification system was created by Erich Moritz von Hornbostel and
Curt Sachs. Among ethnomusicologists, it is the most widely used system for classifying musical
instruments.
Instruments are classified using 5 different categories depending on the manner in which the instrument
creates the sound: Idiophones, Membranophones, Chordophones, Aerophones, & Electrophones.


A subset of the NSynth dataset was used here,  this dataset is a large collection of musical instrument tones from the Google Magenta project. The subset has 10 classes of different musical instruments, including bass, brass, flute, guitar, keyboard, mallet, organ, reed, string and vocal. For our expriment, it is split into training, validation and test sets. For each class, the training set has 100 audio samples and both validation and test sets have 20 audio samples.
